## What points would I improve if I had more time?

### User Interface 

What would I like to improve?

- Improve focus and active actions when the user clicks on the tree view.

- A line under the arrow in tree view.

- Spacings in tree view.

### Code 

- Organizate CSS files and classes.

- Icon Organization.

- Create unit and integration tests.

- Search for bugs in the worst case, this includes: test the application with large datasets and edge cases to ensure stability and performance under extreme conditions and improve error handling mechanisms to manage unexpected inputs or states.

- I would improve the performance and assertiveness of text search
